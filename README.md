resistor-combinator - Generate combinations of resistors in series and parallel.

INTRODUCTION
------------

A single resistor has a single combination.
Two resistors have two combinations: one in series and one in parallel.
Three resistors have many combinations.
How many combinations do n resistors have?

This project aims to answer this question by generating all the possible
combinations and calculating their equivalent resistances.
